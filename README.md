titledb.py: create a database of all the post titles and their corresponding ids. I use it to find where posts are now after the crash. Doesn't work with threads that require an account (The Lounge, Trading Post, Trade Feedback). Should work on any xenforo forum idk.

doomsday.py: download all the forum pages without processing them at all. Meant for "doomsday", when the forum disappears. Doesn't work with threads that require an account (The Lounge, Trading Post, Trade Feedback). Should work on any xenforo forum idk.
